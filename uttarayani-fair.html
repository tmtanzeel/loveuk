					The Uttarayani fairs are often used as platforms by social and political workers and the Bageshwar fair specially has played an important role in all the local movements, as also in the freedom movement. In 1921 activists had given a call for the eventual eradication of the system of bonded labour known as coolie begar. In 1929 Gandhi ji came to Bageshwar. Many freedom fighters and folk singers have been closely associated with the Bageshwar fair. Even today the fair attracts a large number of people, who spend the whole night dancing and singing Jhoras, Chancharis and Bairas.
