					The walk begins with gradual ascent through pine trees, alongside the roaring Bhagirathi River with towering cliffs on your left hand side, and the sheer drop on the right. Soon after one leaves Gangotri, one passes a forest department check post for the “Gangotri Conservation Project”. The money collected from you is utilised to plant trees damaged and cut by years of uncontrolled tourist activities, and to reverse the degradation caused by polythene pollution. It is because of the same, that now the total number of individuals within the Gangotri National Park cannot exceed more than 100 on any given time!
					<br><br>The day’s walk is quite short and is mainly to assist acclimatization. Chirbasa means “abode  of pine trees”.

				</p>
		
				<p>
					<b>Day 08 : Bhojbasa - Gomukh (3890 mts/12760 ft) - Tapovan (4463 mts / 14640 ft)</b>
					Enjoy the panoramic view of Bhagirathi group of peaks while having breakfast. A little while later, trek to Gaumukh Glacier (3890mt), the source of the Ganges. The name 'Gomukh', (meaning Cow’s : mouth) was so named probably because in the distant past, it appeared like a cow's mouth. Explore the area and trek to Tapovan- a fine meadow replete with gurgling streams and velvety grass!. The trek from Gomukh to Tapovan is a steep ascent, over the Gangotri Glacier. The peaks appear to be deceptively close and seem to be just a stone's throw away. Tapovan is finally reached and is known for its beautiful meadows that touches the base of the Shivling peak, The meadow is known as Tapovan, as it might have been used by “Rishis” in the distance past to meditate (Tap means meditation and Van means Jungle in Sanskrit and Hindi), owing to its isolation and natural beauty with hundreds of different wild flowers in full bloom after the spring thaw! Herds of Bharal (blue mountain goats) is a common sight here, and on the far side the Bhagarithi I, II, III (6454mt)peaks , provide an equally impressive backdrop. It is also  little wonder that  Sadhus and Rishis still choose this spot for extended meditation during the long summer month. Arrive Tapovan and camp

<br><br><b>Gomukh :</b> The Gomukh glacier is the source of Bhagirathi (Ganges) and is held in high esteem by the devout who do not miss the opportunity to have a holy dip in the icy waters of the second biggest glacier in India (followed by Siachin glacier).

<br><br><b>Tapovan :</b>Tapovan is the picture perfect location for the the one seeking peace, the artists who needs to be inspired, the author for the quiet , the photographer for the unblemished natural surroundings, the nature lover for the untouched meadows and mountains, and the undisturbed wildlife, the mountaineer - as this is the base camp  for the  daunting Shivling peak ascent. Tapovan is located on an altitude of 4463m / 14640ft above sea level. The up close view of  Bhagirathi peaks from the meadow Tapvan is something to write home about!  Dinner and overnight stay in camp.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 09 : Tapovan - Kirti Bamak - Tapovan (7 kms/6 hrs)</b>
					Early in the morning a full day trek to Kirti Bamak glacier. From here you can see the Kedardome peak (6850 mts/22468 ft), Kirti Bamak (6500 mts/21320 ft) and a magnificent view of Shivling from the east. After exploring the area return to Tapovan for dinner and overnight stay.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 10 : Tapovan - Meru Glacier - Tapovan (5 hrs/6 kms)</b>

Meru crossing the meadows of Tapovan the trail climbs into another valley North – west of Tapovan. The Meru Bamak (Glacier) is set at a 60 degree to the Gangotri glacier. The walking over loose rocks and moraine calls for extra caution as the soil and rock are loosely held in the sandy glacial mud. The view of the Bhagirathi group of peaks to the South – east and the Vasuki Parvat  located East – south East of the Meru glacier present a breathtaking background! After exploring the area return back to Tapovan for dinner and overnight stay.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 11 : Tapovan - Nandanvan (4570 mts/14990 ft/ Trek 4-5 hrs)</b>

The route from Tapovan leads from the upper section of the meadow On traversing the Gaumukh glacier, turning towards Nandanvan (4340m) to the right, one enters the Nandanvan, a beautiful campsite with a crystal clear mountain stream. The Tapovan – Nandanvan trek combines the experience of mountain climbing, rock climbing, boulder-hopping and glacier traversing. Though the trek is not a very rigourous and is easily negotiable by non mountaineers, it still requires caution!. From Nandanvan, the view of the Shivling, Bhagirathi, Sudarshana, Thelu, and Kedar Dome peaks is a photographer’s dream come true! Overnight stay in tents.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 12 : Nandanvan - Vasuki Tal (4800 mts/15744 ft) - Nandanvan (7 kms/6 hrs)</b>
					Trek along a gentle mountain stream towards the East parallel to the Chaturangi Glacier up an incline for almost 1.5 hours till one reaches a glacial valley gouged out by the raw power of an advancing glacier to reach the rim of the gorge. It take as a further 10 minutes of diagonal descent to get to Vasuki lake, roughly North – west of the looming Vasuki Parvat, after first seeing it fron the ridge. The camping area though not very big, is a comfortable ground, a short distance away from the lake. The area commands  a beautiful view of the Vasuki parvat, and a bird’s eye view of the Gangotri valley. The area acts as a base camp base for climbing Mt Satopanth and Mt Vasuki Parbat.
