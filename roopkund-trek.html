				<ul align=left>
					<li><b>"Riddles Of The Dead: Skeleton Lake"</b> as remnants belonging to more than 500 people have been found as locals believed that even more than six hundred people perished near the lake – a long time ago!</li>
					<li>After studying fractures in the skulls, the scientists in Hyderabad, Pune and London determined that the people perished due to hailstorm, with hail as large as cricket balls, and with nowhere to hide, the group perished, and their jewellery, skulls, bones and preserved tissue of bodies can still be discovered today.</li>
					<li>The trek takes one to the  lake located near the base of two Himalayan peaks: Trisul (7120 m) and Nandghungti (6310 m).</li>
					<li>Various religious ceremonies : especially- the “Nanda Devi Raj Jat”, a religious “Yatra” taking place once every twelve years at Roopkund - led by a sacred ram.</li>
					<li>All along the way, one is surrounded by mountain ranges from all sides and the High Altitude Grasslands.</li>				
					<li>The trek is tough at times, as the altitude is the main factor with the added unpredictability of weather at such altitude adding to the challenge!</li>
