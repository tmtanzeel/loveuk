				<p>
					<b>Day 01 : Arrival - Delhi</b>
					On arrival meet our executive and transfer to hotel. After an overnight flight, recover from jet lag by cooling off in a swimming pool , and recharging your energy. Those energetic enough to absorb the sights and sounds of  Delhi, can take a dekko around town, as Delhi  has a lot to offer. Overnight in hotel.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 02 : Delhi - Haridwar - Rishikesh (Train and Drive)</b>
					Morning transfer to the station to board the Shatabdi Express to Haridwar, one of the seven holy cities of Hinduism. The train journey takes about 51/2 hours. Legend has it that Vishnu's footprint was found on the bank of the holy river Ganges, giving it it's sanctity. Situated at the base of the Shivalik Hills, Haridwar is where the River Ganga (Ganges) passes through the last mountains and begins its 2,000 km journey across the plains of India, finally terminating at the  the Bay of Bengal.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 03: Drive via Srinagar to Gholtir (2,116 ft/ 645 metres) and trek to Kothki Sam (2083 ft/ 635 metres) (2 hours' drive time, 1 hour trekking).</b>
					About an hour's drive from Srinagar takes one to Gulabrai, just before Rudraprayag. This is the place where Jim Corbett made his famous 'Shot in the dark' and killed the Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag. Here there is a commemorative plaque on the exact spot below the tree where Corbett established the Machan and killed the notorious  leopard reputed to have killed upwards of 125 people before Jim Corbett's single shot put paid to its reign of terror. Corbett stayed on his tree platform (Machan) until it was light- for fear that he had only wounded the animal that locals believed was an 'evil spirit'. Nearby is the 'Pundit's House' where you may meet Totaram- the grandson of the pundit, who was Corbett's friend. He will show you a photo of his grandfather and Corbett, and a copy of Corbett's book describing the hunt.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 04 : Kothki Sam - Ishala (4593 ft/ 1400 metres/ 6 hours Trek)</b>
					At Kodadkhal there is a red stone memorial to local 'Freedom Fighters' in a walled enclosure. After Kodadkhal the path climbs steadily through a Fir forest to reach a ridge from where one can see down into the next valley. Going along the ridge one finally gets to see Ishala. High mountain tops rise beyond and you can see the 'pass' with a village on the west. One has to stop at Ishala for the night. Overnight in tents.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 05 : Ishala - Aagar (6555 ft/ 1998 metres/ 5 hours Trek)</b>
					Initially the climb is stiff for about an hour to reach the 'pass'. The trail passes through forests with an abundance in birdlife. From the crest of the ridge there are views of giant peaks to the north, Chaukhamba (23,418 ft/ 7,138 metres), just peeping over the ridge in front . One now approaches the village of Kandi (5,508 ft/ 1,679 metres).The next village, Jagtoli (5,310ft/1,771metres) is clearly seen on the next ridge and it looks within the reach of an easy trek. We contour around past terraced fields to come up to this village astride the ridge of the mountain.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 06 : Aagar - Gimtoli (6391 ft / 1948 metres) and continue trek to Forest Camp (5249 ft/ 1600 metres)</b>
					It is a 5 hour trek to Aagar Pass (6,624 ft/ 2,019 metres) from where there are magestic views of Kedarnath (22,769 ft/ 6,940 metres), Kedar Dome and Chaukhamba. Looking down into the valley is the village of Gimtoli (6,503 ft/ 1,982 metres) and below that a school ground.
					At Gimtoli there is a motorable road to Kanak Chauri (7,109 ft/ 2,167 metres), a small village by the road. From the village the walk up to Kartik Swami Temple (8,163 ft/ 2,488 metres) takes about an hour. This is a pleasant walk through wooded hillsides to the top of the ridge. One passes several houses occupied by Sadhus (holy men). The Temple itself was destroyed on 25 April, 1999 by an earthquake with its epicentre some 60 kms from here. This Temple has now been re-built.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 07 : Trek from Forest Camp to Sodi (2677 ft/ 816 metres) and drive to Rudraprayag</b>
					The trail descends downhill passing through scenic countryside and villages of Mangu and Bathwari. Next up is Deodar village.The road to Kedarnath with the Mandakani River flowing beside it can be seen from here. The vehicle ride from Sodi terminates at Rudraprayag ,the night halt. Overnight in tents.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<b>Day 08 : Drive from Rudraprayag to Gangotri ( 10170 ft/ 3100 metres )</b>
					The drive takes one to Gangotri from Rudraprayag. One gets to see many Sadhus and other holy men with a significant number of foreigners. Legend has it that Gangotri's spectacular waterfall marks the spot where the Goddess Ganga descended from heaven in ancient times. Here Lord Shiva absorbed celestial torrent into his locks and the Ganges split into four sacred rivers - Bhagirathi, Yamanu, Mandakini and Alaknanda.
					Overnight in guest house at Gangotri
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 09 : Trek from Gangotri to Chirbasa (11549 ft/ 3606 metres/ 4 hours)</b>
					On reaching Chirbasa  one establishes camp for the night, and to acclimatize to the extreme altitudes in the following days and get superb views of Manda peak (20,853 ft/ 6511 metres), Hanuman Tibba (17,186 ft/ 5366 metres), Bhrigu Parbat (19,217 ft/ 6000 metres), Bhagirathi I, II and III (21,958 ft/ 6856 metres, 20,857 ft/ 6512 metres, and 20,671 ft/ 6454 metres respectively).
					Overnight in tents.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 10 : Trek from Chirbasa to Gaumaukh (12769 ft/ 3892 metres/ 4 hours)</b>
					It is a two hour trek to Bhojvasa (12,145 ft/ 3792 metres) which has an Ashram, a Tourist guest house and a Police outpost. Though barren and desolate at first sight, this is a haven for wildlife and exotic flora. It is not rare to spot large herds of Himalayan Ibex, and if lucky, one might even get to catch a fleeting glimpse of the elusive snow leopard! The view of the towering peak of Shivling (20,956 ft/ 6543 metres) gives one ample opportunities to take prize winning pictures  of the majestic mountain! The trail from Bhojbasa to Gaumukh is a continuous yet fairly gradual ascent. The name Gaumukh  is derived from the words  "Gau" - cow, and "Mukh" – mouth, is so revered that Hindus believe that a dip in the freezing waters absolves them of past sins, and helps them attain “Moksha”
					Overnight in tents.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 11 : Trek from Gaumauk to Tapovan (14294 ft/ 4463 metres/ 3 hours)</b>
					Inspite a short walk,  the trek is very tiring and  strenuous owing to the effect of high altitude, and the lack of oxygen. The trek begins over rocky boulders and becomes noticeably steep gradually over the rocky terrain. The glacier is covered by moraine so you do not need any technical equipment, although a stout trekking pole is definitelyuseful. The final push takes one into  Tapovan (Loose translation : Forest of Meditation) meadows and view the spectacular sight all around is indeed a sight for sore eyes. The ccompany of giants, such as  - Shivling, Meru, Manda, the Bhagirathi and its two sister peaks makes one feel humbled and full awe. The grassy slopes provide an ideal base for pitching tents. The surroundings are beautiful beyond description! Overnight in tents.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 12 : Trek from Tapovan to Chirbasa (6 hours)</b>
					Rise early to see the spectacular sight of the sunrise on the surrounding 6000 metre peaks. Shivling is undoubtedly the star of the show, commanding instant attention as it soars dramatically into the sky, dwarfing its neighbours.
					Retrace your steps to Chirvasa. A steep descent down to the glacier is followed by a rocky traverse of the glacier for a second time and a gradual descent to Chirbvsa marks the end of the day. Overnight in tents.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 13 : Trek from Chirbasa to Gangotri and drive to Uttarkashi</b>
					A 3 hour downhill trek from Chirvasa gets one to Gangotri , and the 6 hour drive ends at Uttarkashi. This little town is situated on a wide  river valley on the banks of the river Bhagirathi at an altitude of about 4,964 ft/ 1,550 metres. The temples and Ghats have names almost identical to those in Varanasi, the historical holy city in the Indian plains. The most important temple here dedicated to Shiva is known as Vishwanath Mandir. Here stands a magnificent Trishul (trident) one meter in circumference and made of copper
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 14 : Drive from Uttarkashi to Rishikesh</b>
					The drive to Rishikesh takes about 6 hours. There will be plenty of time in the late afternoon and evening to visit the bazaars and ashrams of Rishikesh. Rishikesh is essentially a pilgrim town and the bulk of the pilgrims are simple villagers whose intense devotion give both Haridwar and Rishikesh a special atmosphere, and a taste of the “Authentic India” that continues to flow in modern times. At sundown each evening there is a spectacular  "Aarti" ceremony at the side of the river, at the bathing Ghat where tiny floating butter lamps are lit and let adrift in the waters of the Ganga as an offering to the gods, and a prayer to for departed ancestors. Overnight stay at hotel.
