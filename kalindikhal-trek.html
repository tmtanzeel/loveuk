				<p>
					<b>Day 08 : Tapovan - Nandanvan (4340 mts / 4500mts) Trek 4-5 hrs</b>

From Gomukh one turns towards Nandanvan and taking the right hand side, one arrives on top of the Gangotri glacier. The glacier runs between two ranges and the landslides creates a layer of rocky moraine on the ice which makes  walking on it easier.

					Post breakfast, one starts the trek to Suraiaya Bamak (Khara Pathar) with packed lunch, for almost 5 kms of steep climb over the moraine, and then diagonally crossing the glacier to cross it to the left over loose moraine! Sounds of the cracking of the glacier under the  feet,  and distant avalanches in the surrounding mountains  are clearly heard in the silenced ascent to the top.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 11 : Khara Pathar - Sweta Glacier (5500 mts) Trek 4 kms / 5-6 hrs</b>
					After breakfast,  the 700 metres or so walk covering the steep moraine looks deceptively simple, but the altitude makes this ascent an uphill task! The 3 – 4 Kms of the day’s walk take almost 5 -6 hrs to cover. Sweta Glacier at 5500 mts sits on a very windy mountain top and tent pegs are  often uprooted and tents lost due to the windy conditions here! Commanding views of the peaks mentioned the previous day are still visible. Dinner and overnight stay in tents.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Day 12 : Sweta Glacier - Kalindikhal Base</b>

Overnight stay in tent.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 13 : Kalindi Base - Kalindi Peak (Kalindi Pass (5947 mts)</b>

				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 14 : Kalindikhal - Raja Parav (4910 m/16105 ft) Trek (12 kms / 6-7 hrs)</b>
					An early start at 6 am after a heavy breakfast marks the beginning of the 10 hr descent to the lower reaches- the first 5 – 6 hours covering frozen ground, and the remaining time loose gravel and moraine. Caution is advised at this point as tired legs and energy depleted bodies make easy targets of slipping and injury! Trek down to Raj Parav to a clearing in the moraine , in time for dinner and overnight stay in the camp.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 15 : Raja Parav - Arwa Tal (3910 m)Trek 14 kms</b>
					Proceed very early after a quick breakfast on the last tough stretch of the trek towards Arwa Tal (3910 mts). The glacial river increase its  flow after the melt  by 10 – 11 am, and crossing anytime after this time is not advised in its torrential waters. The trek on this day covers almost  14 km  and takes a total time of 6 – 7 hrs, terminating at the banks of a river. Overnight in the camp.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Day 16 : Arwa Tal - Ghastoli (3796 m/12450 ft) Trek (15 kms / 6-7 hrs)</b>
					Proceed for the relatively easy 14 – 15 kms of undulating ground after breakfast towards Ghastoli (3796 m),! The path is still trechearous and one might witness several rock falls en route. The first signs of trees and shrubbery are seen from this point on, and the path is a series, of flat ground, dips and small climbs along the valley! The first signs of habitation in the form of the Indo Tibet Border Patrol (ITBP) camps are seen as the area is very close to the China border. Shepherds, their animals, and green patches of grass are a welcome sight!. Dinner and overnight stay in camp.
				</p>

				<p>
