					<li>The uniqueness of the Kumaoni Holi lies in its being a musical affair, whichever may be its form, be it the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi or the Mahila Holi.</li>
					<li>The Baithki Holi and Khari Holi are unique in that the songs on which they are based have touch of melody, fun and spiritualism.</li>
					<li>These songs are essentially based on classical ragas.</li>
					<li>No wonder then the Baithki Holi is also known as Nirvan Ki Holi.</li>
					<li>This festival also <strong>marks the beginning of holi baithaks.</strong></li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The Baithki Holi begins from the premises of temples, where Holiyars (the professional singers of Holi songs) as also the people gather to sing songs to the accompaniment of classical music.
					<br><br>Kumaonis are very particular about the time when the songs based on ragas should be sung. For instance, at noon the songs based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas are sung while evening is reserved for the songs based on the ragas like Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman etc.
					<br><br>The Khari Holi is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, who sporting traditional white churidar payajama and kurta, dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments.
